Respected Professor,

Still working on the game, my platforms are only till 5 and I need to figure out a way to repeat them. RIght now the ball jumps till platform 5.
Also I tried to add the slider feature, in all I still need time to add few features and get the game into deployable phase currently it's basically in the prototype mode.
Would request some more time or grade accordingly.

Sincerely,
Dipankar
